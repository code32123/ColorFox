# ColorFox
Colorful icons for your FireFox!

## Why?
I use a bunch of different firefox profiles all pinned to my taskbar, and would like to be able to tell them apart. Now, each profile can have it's own pretty color!

## Attribution
The color schemes are stolen directly from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/i0ncu4/colorfox_extended_icons_pack/), where all the links had died. So I downloaded the default firfox svg, threw it in gimp, layer-masked the different bits, and painted the new color schemes onto it.

## Obviously
I don't own the firefox logo. That's his. I stole the logo, and I stole the colors, and I redid someone elses work (but worse) because their link died. Do with that what you will.
